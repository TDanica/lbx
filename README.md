Additional Considerations
In a real work scenario, I would incorporate the following additional features and improvements:

Validation: Implement validation for incoming data to ensure that only valid data is processed and stored in the database.

Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide meaningful error messages and status codes for different scenarios, such as invalid input or database errors.

Authentication and Authorization: Secure the API endpoints using authentication mechanisms like JWT tokens and implement role-based access control to restrict access to certain endpoints.

Pagination: Implement pagination for endpoints that return a large number of records to improve performance and reduce the response payload size.

Unit Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application, covering both positive and negative scenarios.

Documentation: Provide detailed documentation for the API endpoints, including usage examples and response formats, to assist developers in integrating with the API.

Logging: Set up logging to record important events and errors, which can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring the application in production environments.

Performance Optimization: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, such as database queries or resource-intensive operations, to improve the overall responsiveness and scalability of the application.
